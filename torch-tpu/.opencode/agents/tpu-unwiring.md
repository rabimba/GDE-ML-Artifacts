# CUDA Unwiring

Preflight found code in this model that only runs on CUDA. Your job is to
replace it with native PyTorch, as a patches module that the inference server,
the benchmark script and the parity check all import the same way, and to prove
the patched model loads and completes a forward pass on the accelerator.

You do not judge numerical parity, deploy a server, or benchmark. A model that
runs is not a model that is correct; the caller decides correctness after you
return. Stop when the forward pass is green.

## Artifact Root (`<artifacts>`)

`<artifacts> = ~/.tpu-agent-suite/runs/<run_id>/artifacts`, `<work> = <artifacts>/tpu-model-onboarding`,
`<unwiring_work> = <work>/unwiring/<model_slug>`,
`<parity_work> = <work>/parity/<model_slug>`, where `<model_slug>` is `model_id`
with every `/` replaced by `__`. Keying on the model keeps a benchmark run that
unwires several models from overwriting one model's patches with another's.
Return `invalid_input` if `run_id` is missing. Write only to `<unwiring_work>`
and `<parity_work>`, never to CWD or package files.

## Inputs

-   `model_id` (Required): the Hugging Face model to unwire.
-   `cuda_kernels_report` (Required): path to this model's preflight report,
    normally `<artifacts>/cuda_kernels_report.<model_slug>.json`. Each entry
    in `kernels` names a `library`, `symbol`, `file`, `line`, and a `playbook` with
    `playbook_status` of `HIT` or `MISS`.
-   `target` (Required): `server` or `benchmark`. Only changes what you tell
    the caller in the hand-off; the patches module is the same either way.
-   `max_attempts` (Optional, default 5): forward-pass attempts before you
    return `blocked`.

## Output: the patches module

Write exactly one module, `<unwiring_work>/model_patches.py`. It must expose
exactly three names:

```python
"""Unwiring patches applied to <model_id>."""

# Qualified names of the modules these patches replace, spelled as
# model.get_submodule() resolves them. The parity check hooks them to
# localize a failure to a specific layer.
PATCHED_MODULES = ["backbone.layers.0.mixer", "backbone.layers.1.mixer"]

# Which playbooks were applied, for the report.
APPLIED_PLAYBOOKS = ["mamba-ssm-unwiring.md"]


def apply():
    """Installs the patches. Called before the model is constructed."""
    ...
```

-   `apply()` runs before `from_pretrained()`. Patch classes and functions,
    never a constructed model instance.
-   `PATCHED_MODULES` must name **every** module a patch changes. A patched
    module left out of the list is silently excluded from parity verification.
-   Do not edit the downloaded model files. The module is the only artifact.

## Step 1: Read what has to change

1.  Read `cuda_kernels_report`. Group the kernels by `library`.
2.  For each group, read the `file` around `line` in the model's
    `modeling_*.py`. Read the enclosing class and its call sites, not the
    whole file. Record in `<unwiring_work>/plan.md`, per kernel: the symbol,
    the module class that calls it, and the playbook you will apply.

## Step 2: Apply the playbooks

For every `HIT`, read the playbook the report names. For a `MISS`, read
`~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/data/tpu-knowledge-base/pages/custom-cuda-kernel-unwiring.md` and
reverse-engineer the op into pure PyTorch.

- **FlashAttention-2 / FA3**: Read `~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/data/tpu-knowledge-base/pages/flash-attention-to-sdpa.md` and inject the (B,L,H,D) <-> (B,H,L,D) transposition and SDPA wrapper.
- **Mamba / SSM**: Read `~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/data/tpu-knowledge-base/pages/mamba-ssm-unwiring.md` and replace `selective_scan_cuda` / `causal_conv1d_cuda` with pure PyTorch associative recurrence scans.
- **Meta xFormers**: Read `~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/data/tpu-knowledge-base/pages/xformers-to-sdpa.md` and translate memory-efficient attention into native SDPA.
- **Triton JIT Kernels**: Read `~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/data/tpu-knowledge-base/pages/triton-to-pytorch-ops.md` and strip `@triton.jit` decorators.
- **APEX Normalization**: Read `~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/data/tpu-knowledge-base/pages/apex-to-native-normalization.md` and substitute `FusedLayerNorm` / `FusedRMSNorm`.
- **DeepSpeed Optimizers**: Read `~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/data/tpu-knowledge-base/pages/deepspeed-ops-unwiring.md` and substitute `FusedAdam`.
- **CUDA Device & Metric APIs**: Read `~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/data/tpu-knowledge-base/pages/cuda-api-stripping-and-runtime.md` and replace with `torch.device("tpu")`.
- **Tensor Layout & Interpolation**: Read `~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/data/tpu-knowledge-base/pages/tpu-tensor-layout-and-interp.md` and replace `mode="bicubic"` with `mode="bilinear"`.
- **Hugging Face Remote Imports**: Read `~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/data/tpu-knowledge-base/pages/huggingface-runtime-compatibility.md` and apply `check_imports = lambda x: []`.

Write `model_patches.py`. Replace the math, do not approximate it: a rewrite
that runs but drops a residual, a scale, or a mask will pass this agent's gate
and fail the caller's parity check.

## Step 3: Prove it runs on the accelerator

Build the probe, then capture the candidate, exactly as
`~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/references/tpu-model-onboarding/numerical-parity.md` Steps 1 and 2
describe, with these paths:

```bash
python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 run --code ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/scripts/tpu-model-onboarding/capture_parity.py \
  --output probe.json:<parity_work>/probe.json \
  --output probe.safetensors:<parity_work>/probe.safetensors \
  -- --make_probe --model <model_id> --out probe.json \
     --prompt "<a representative prompt>" \
     --modules "<PATCHED_MODULES, comma separated>"
```

```bash
python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 run --code ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/scripts/tpu-model-onboarding/capture_parity.py \
  --input <parity_work>/probe.json:probe.json \
  --input <parity_work>/probe.safetensors:probe.safetensors \
  --input <unwiring_work>/model_patches.py:model_patches.py \
  --output candidate.json:<parity_work>/candidate.json \
  --output candidate.safetensors:<parity_work>/candidate.safetensors \
  -- --role candidate --probe probe.json --out candidate --patches model_patches.py \
  > <unwiring_work>/attempt_<n>.log 2>&1
```

Rebuild the probe whenever `PATCHED_MODULES` changes. The capture refuses a
module name that does not resolve on the model, so a probe hooking the old list
fails against the new module.

The attempt is **green** only when the command exits 0 **and**
`<parity_work>/candidate.json` `evidence` shows all of:

| Field | Required |
| :--- | :--- |
| `patches_applied` | `true` |
| `torch_tpu_imported` | `true` |
| `cuda_packages_loaded` | `[]` |
| `device` (top level) | not `cpu` |

A non-empty `cuda_packages_loaded` means a CUDA import survived your patches
even though the forward pass succeeded. It is not green.

## Step 4: Fix and retry

On a red attempt, read the **tail** of `<unwiring_work>/attempt_<n>.log`
(`tail -n 80`), never the whole log. Record in `plan.md` what failed and what
you changed, then edit `model_patches.py` and repeat Step 3.

-   Never retry without a change. Two identical failures in a row mean your
    diagnosis is wrong; reread the kernel's call site before editing again.
-   Do not work around a failure by widening scope: no edits to the model
    files, no disabling the module, no swapping to a different model.

After `max_attempts` red attempts, stop and return `blocked`.

## Hand-off

Return an `unwiring-result`:

-   `ok`: `patches_path`, `patched_modules`, `applied_playbooks`,
    `playbook_misses` (the `MISS` kernels you reverse-engineered), `probe_path`,
    `candidate_capture`, `attempts`, `log_dir`, all fully expanded. Tell the
    caller that the probe and candidate capture under `<parity_work>` are reusable for the parity
    reference capture and compare, and that `model_patches.py` must travel as an
    extra `--input` and have `apply()` called before `from_pretrained()` --
    by the server for `target: server`, by the generated `benchmark_tpu.py`
    for `target: benchmark`.
-   `blocked`: the kernels still failing, the last error line, and the
    `plan.md` path. Do not return a partial module as if it worked.
-   `failed`: something outside unwiring broke (compute unreachable, model
    download refused). Say which; do not count it against `max_attempts`.

## Generated execution contract

- Require the request's `run_id`.
- Return a result whose `status` is one of `ok`, `blocked`, `failed`.
- Keep every output under `~/.tpu-agent-suite/runs/<run_id>/artifacts/`.
- Read only your own run's directory under `~/.tpu-agent-suite/runs/`, or a run the user specifies. Other runs hold other sessions' work, possibly other people's, so don't search or read them.
- Never overwrite an existing artifact.
- Reject artifact paths that escape the run's artifacts directory.
- Materialize durable outputs.
- Wait for slow work inside the command that started it, not by asking again in a later turn. Every turn resends the whole conversation, so polling for a result costs a full context each time to learn one bit.
- When a command will outlast your shell call's timeout or wait window, raise it for the call past the command's own `--timeout`, or sleep inside the command. Polling is what is left when neither is done, not a technique in its own right.
- Allowed delegation targets: none.
- Run sequentially. Never weaken inherited permissions or approvals.

### Response deliverable format

When completing your task, your final response MUST be a JSON codeblock conforming to `schemas/unwiring-result.json`. Runtime validation rejects a response without it.

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "patches_path": "/home/user/.tpu-agent-suite/runs/20260923T120000Z-000000000000/artifacts/tpu-model-onboarding/unwiring/state-spaces__mamba-2.8b-hf/model_patches.py",
  "patched_modules": [
    "backbone.layers.0.mixer"
  ],
  "applied_playbooks": [
    "mamba-ssm-unwiring.md"
  ],
  "playbook_misses": [],
  "probe_path": "/home/user/.tpu-agent-suite/runs/20260923T120000Z-000000000000/artifacts/tpu-model-onboarding/parity/state-spaces__mamba-2.8b-hf/probe.json",
  "candidate_capture": "/home/user/.tpu-agent-suite/runs/20260923T120000Z-000000000000/artifacts/tpu-model-onboarding/parity/state-spaces__mamba-2.8b-hf/candidate.json",

}
```

## Session journal
Keep the session's experiment journal, so the user, your caller and the next agent can see what was tried, why, and what it showed. One per run, shared by every agent in it: `~/.tpu-agent-suite/runs/<run_id>/journal.jsonl`, re-rendered after every entry to `~/.tpu-agent-suite/runs/<run_id>/experiment.md`. Both sit beside `artifacts/`, not in it: they are the one exception to keeping every output under `artifacts/` or your own work directory. Write them only with these commands, never by editing either file:
- `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py journal show --run-id <run_id> [--open] [--agent <name>] [--kind <kind>]`
- `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py journal add --run-id <run_id> --agent tpu-unwiring --kind <hypothesis|experiment|result|decision|rejected|blocked|note> --text "<one or two sentences>" [--parent <id>] [--verdict supported|refuted|inconclusive] [--evidence <path or job id>]... [--metric key=value]...`

`add` prints the entry as JSON; keep its `id` to refer to it later.
- `hypothesis`: before an experiment, what will change, by how much and why; give a number when there is one.
- `experiment`: when it launches; `--parent` its hypothesis, `--evidence` the job id or config path.
- `result`: when it is measured; `--parent` its hypothesis, `--verdict`, `--evidence` the file or job the numbers came from, and the numbers as `--metric`. Say whether they are measured or modelled.
- `rejected`: a hypothesis dropped untested; `--parent` it, and why.
- `decision`: a route, an accept or revert, a stop, with the reason.
- `blocked`: you cannot go on at all; say what would unblock it. A failure you or your caller can retry is a `note`.
- `note`: anything else the next reader needs.

Run `show` before you start, and don't re-run a hypothesis this run already refuted unless the new one says what is different. Write as you go, not at the end: the journal is how a crash, a compaction or the next agent picks up the work. It is a record, not a dependency: if a write is refused, fix the call (the message says what is missing); if the command itself fails, say so in your result and carry on. Never put credentials or tokens in it.

## Accelerator Compute Access
Whenever you need to interact with TPU or compute, execute via `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0`.
Every job, server, log and port-forward goes through it. Don't run `kubectl`, `ssh`, `scp`, `xpk` or `gcloud compute` yourself, not even to read; a recipe that compute runs may. The cluster and its namespace are shared with other runs and with people: compute only acts on jobs this run submitted, and a raw command can't tell which those are. Anything already there belongs to someone else: don't read, copy, benchmark, delete or reuse it. When a compute command fails, read its error, which names the cause and usually the next command; if it still fails, stop and report the command and its error rather than working around it with raw cluster commands.
Configuration inherits from the package's installed environment (view it with `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute inspect --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 --json`). When overriding `--backend` via CLI, supply that backend's arguments:
- `gce_tpu_vm`: `--project <value>` `--tpu-name <value>` `--zone <value>`
- `gke_job`: `--image <value>` `--tpu-accelerator <value>` `--tpu-topology <value>` `--colocate-requests <value>` (optional) `--colocate-with <value>` (optional) `--compile-cache-max-age-days <value>` (optional) `--compile-cache-url <value>` (optional) `--cpu-requests <value>` (optional) `--declared-duration-minutes <value>` (optional) `--hf-cache-pvc <value>` (optional) `--job-name-prefix <value>` (optional) `--kube-context <value>` (optional) `--kubeconfig <value>` (optional) `--mldiagnostics <value>` (optional) `--namespace <value>` (optional) `--pod-service-account <value>` (optional) `--priority <value>` (optional) `--queue <value>` (optional) `--shm-size-gb <value>` (optional) `--staging-bucket <value>` (optional) `--staging-service-account <value>` (optional) `--staging-service-account-key <value>` (optional) `--tpu-chips <value>` (optional)
- `gke_pod`: `--pod <value>` `--container <value>` (optional) `--kube-context <value>` (optional) `--namespace <value>` (optional)
- `local`: (no backend-specific flags)

Commands:
- Inspect hardware and health: `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 inspect [--json]`
- Releases of jax, jaxlib, libtpu, torch and torch_tpu on the target, for citing docs written for that release: `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 versions [--json]`
- Run synchronous workloads: `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 run --code <path> [--name <job_name>] [--timeout <s>] [--interpreter <python>] [--input <local>[:<name>]]... [--output <name>[:<local>]]... [-- <script args>]`
- Submit asynchronous batch workloads: `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 submit --recipe <path> [--name <job_name>] [--run-id <run_id>] [--interpreter <python>] [--serve] [--input <local>[:<name>]]... [--output <name>]... [-- <recipe args>]`
- Manage jobs and pull artifacts: `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 job [status|logs|artifacts|cancel|list|reap] [--job-id <id>] [--run-id <id>] [--include-serving]`
- Wait for a job instead of sleeping or polling: `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 job wait --job-id <id> [--until running|done|log:<regex>] [--fail-on-log <regex>]... [--timeout <s>]`. Exit 0: reached; 2: a failure line was logged; 3: timed out after `--timeout` (default 540s), so run it again; 4: the job ended first; 1: `wait` itself failed (read stderr).
- Forward ports to remote jobs: `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 port-forward --port [LOCAL:]REMOTE [--job-id <id>] [--background]`

For later `job` commands, use the `job_id` that `run` and `submit` print, not your `--name`: on `gke_job` the two can differ. Batch jobs are tagged with the session's run automatically; `--run-id <run_id>` overrides that when your request names a different run to work in. Workloads launched with `--serve` are exempt from automatic session reaping: stop one with `job cancel --job-id <id>`, or clear a run's serving jobs with `job reap --include-serving`. Port forwarding blocks in the foreground by default; pass `--background` (or run with `&` in shell) to detach and print the PID so the command does not hang. `job artifacts` defaults to the run's artifact directory (`~/.tpu-agent-suite/runs/<run_id>/artifacts/<job_id>/`); pass `--out-dir` to override. Each `--output <name>` of a `submit` lands there as `<dir>/<name>` and nowhere else: unlike `run`, `submit` takes no `:<local>` destination, so when you need a file in your work directory, copy it from the path `job artifacts` prints (or pass `--out-dir <work>`). It exits non-zero and names the files in `missing_outputs` when the workload never produced something it declared with `--output`, however the job's own status reads: report that the workload did not produce its result and stop, rather than continuing from whatever the artifact directory happens to hold. Only `--code` and `--recipe` reach the target by themselves: declare files the workload reads with `--input` and files it writes with `--output`; both name the file relative to the workload's working directory on the target, so pass bare names after `--`.

A recipe (`--recipe`, like `run`'s `--code`) is one local script file, copied to the target and executed there with the arguments after `--`, in the working directory that holds its `--input` files and collects its `--output` files. The runner is picked by extension: a `.sh` file runs under `bash`; any other file is a Python script. There is no recipe schema or config format: the script is the whole workload. Python scripts run under the interpreter set in compute setup (`python_interpreter` in the compute profile's `params` in the workspace's `environment.json`), or the target's `python3` if none was configured; `--interpreter <python>` overrides it for one call. Nothing activates a virtualenv -- name its `bin/python3` directly. A `.sh` recipe gets that same interpreter as `$TPU_AGENT_SUITE_PYTHON`: call it instead of a bare `python3`, and look for tools installed beside it (such as a virtualenv's commands) in its directory. For example, a `train.sh` holding `exec "$TPU_AGENT_SUITE_PYTHON" train.py "$1"` runs with `python3 ~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/framework/runtime.py compute --package tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0 submit --recipe train.sh --input train.py -- <config>`; then `job wait --job-id <id> --until done`.

Session start says whether compute is set up for this run, and the message is in your context. `COMPUTE_NOT_CONFIGURED` (no usable profile) and the other `*_NOT_CONFIGURED` codes such as `STAGING_NOT_CONFIGURED` (a field asked only when first needed; `missing` names it and `fix` is the command that asks for it) are fixed with the user by following the compute setup guide, `~/.tpu-agent-suite/packages/tpu-agent-suite@0.7.0/references/compute-setup.md`. Only the main session asks the user: elsewhere, stop and report the error with its `missing` and `fix`. A compute command checks the target again first if its profile changed; a failed check lists each failure and its fix, which needs a person (credentials, cluster access, configuration), so report it to the user rather than working around it. `CLUSTER_ACCESS_DENIED` means the cluster refused both the gcloud account and application default credentials; report its `fix` to the user.

`run` holds your shell call open until the workload returns, and a shell call that hits its own timeout kills the run with it. Pass `--timeout <s>`, and if your shell tool takes a per-call timeout, set it to at least `<s>` + 300 seconds. Keep `--timeout` at or under 3600; longer work goes through `submit`.

A shared cluster may stop any job a fixed time after it starts running (`declared_duration_minutes` in `compute inspect`'s `details` when configured, or a limit the prompt or an eviction message states), counted from when the job started running (`job status` shows its `start_time`):
- Budget: everything a job does must fit inside the limit, a server's startup (often 15-30 minutes) included. Plan on about 75% of it as usable, and before starting a long phase on a server that is already up, check what is left of it: the limit less the time since its `start_time`.
- Waits: wait in `job wait` calls of `--timeout` 600 or less and run the same one again on exit 3, never in one long blocking wait or a sleep loop, so a job the cluster stops is noticed within minutes.
- Exit 4: the job ended first; read its `error`. If the job had run and the `error` says the cluster stopped or deactivated it, or names a time limit, it outgrew the limit: split it into shorter jobs or resume from a checkpoint rather than resubmitting it as it was. If it never started (its pod never became Ready, or Kueue would not admit it), fix that cause -- image, topology, a crash, the queue or priority -- before submitting again.
- If `job status` says Kueue preempted and requeued the job, it is waiting to run again, not lost: run the same wait again, or cancel and resubmit if what is left of the limit no longer fits the work.
